## CET typescript template
This project enables you to write Cyber Engine Tweaks scripts in Typescript and transpile them into lua for use in the game.

### setup
```
npm install
```


### build
```
npm run build
```
The lua bundle is saved to dist/bundle.lua.


### usage
This template contains automatically generated bindings to most functions exposed by the game's scripting language. You can leverage them for auto-completion and error checking.
I recommend use of VS Code for a good IDE experience.
